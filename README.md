# APEX — Public

APEX is a reality filter for decision-making under uncertainty.

It is not a trading bot.
It is not a prediction engine.
It is a decision framework designed to operate in hostile, noisy, and unstable environments.

---

## What APEX does

- Observes market conditions
- Filters unreliable signals
- Acts only when conditions are structurally favorable
- Preserves capital as a primary constraint

APEX does not seek maximum profit.
It seeks survivability first, performance second.

---

## Core principles

- No emotion
- No belief
- No prediction
- Only structure, thresholds, and constraints

APEX does not "win".
It remains.

---

## Status

This repository contains:
- A public conceptual model
- A simplified reference implementation

Private and advanced versions are intentionally excluded.
